## Objective
Supervised Learning Binary Classification problem [0,1] by predicting if a hotel guest will attend or cancel their reservation. With a final metric of %, this model allows the hospitality industry to find the optimal frontier of services based on attended guests such as food requirements, seasonal patterns, price optimization, availability, employment efficiencies, targeted country marketing, etc. 

## Models
- Principal Component Analysis: Reduce the dimensionality of the data 
- Logistic Regression:
- Artificial Neural Network:

## For Stakeholders 
- Percentage of canceled hotel reservations 37%
- Total percentage canceled for Resort and City Hotels:  28% and 42%, respectively 
- Price per Capita: $52
- Top three home country of guests: Portugal (28%), United Kingdom (13%), France (11%) 
- Percentage of canceled hotel based on country: Portugal (63%)
- Monthly High Price for City & Resort Hotels: April-October and July-August, respectively
- Top three Average Daily Rate (ADR) based on month: August ($140), July ($127), June ($117)
- Customer Type that cancels: Groups customertype have a higher cancelation rate over 50%

```
## Objective
An unsupervised learning model to seek clusters in our population data that reveal some sort of demographic traits the define their similarities for different regions (Indexed by concatinating State-County) in the United States. Their similarities will help reveal unseen patterns that help inform campaigns, marketing targets, for a specific cluster.  

## Models
- Principal Component Analysis: Reduce the dimensionality of the data
- K Means Clustering:
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN):
- Artificial Neural Network:

## For Stakeholders 
- Typical county has around 30% Professional Workers
- Top Three Expensive State-County: Virginia-FallsChurch city, New York-New York, Virginia-Arlington
- Top Five Highest Unemployment Rate: Puerto Rico (Adjuntas, Lares, Jayuya, Orocovis, Cata√±o) also the poorest area
- Top Three Total Population: California-Los Angeles, Illinois-Cook, Texas-Harris
- Top Three employed percentage based on total population: Alaska-Aleutians East Borough, Hawaii-Kalawao, Alaska-Skagway Municipality
