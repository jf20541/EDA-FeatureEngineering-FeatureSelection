# Hotel Bookings
Supervised Learning Binary Classification problem [0,1] by predicting [Hotel Bookings Data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) guests would attend or cancel their reservation. With a final metric of %, this model allows the hospitality industry to find the optimal frontier of services based on attended guests such as food requirements, seasonal patterns, price optimization, availability, employment efficiencies, targeted country marketing, etc.

# Population Segmentation
An unsupervised learning model to seek clusters in the [Population Segmentation Data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XTXCYD) and 
[US Census Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) that reveal some sort of demographic traits the define their similarities for different regions (Indexed by concatenating State-County) in the United States. Their similarities will help reveal unseen patterns that help inform campaigns, marketing targets, for a specific cluster.

# Health Insurance
Explore the [Kaggle Health Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction)
and build two models to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from the previous year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

  <summary> Data and Models </summary>

  ```
  Binary Targets:['Response']  (Customer is interested:1,Customer is not interested:0)
  Categorical Features: ['Gender','Vehicle_Age','Vehicle_Damage']
  Numerical Features ['Age','Driving_License','Previously_Insured','Vintage','Annual_Premium','Policy_Sales_Channel']

  - Cat Boost Classifier
</details>

## For Stakeholders 
- Percentage of Customers that are Interested: 10.12%
- Customer with their vehicle damaged in the past tend to be interested
- Customer with no Vehicle Insurance tend to be interested
- Vehicle Age of 1-2 years tend to be interested
- Average Age: 39 Years old
